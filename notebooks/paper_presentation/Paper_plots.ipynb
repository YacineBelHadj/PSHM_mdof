    "A significant challenge in developing an SHM strategy for civil infrastructure is that except for certain types of public and private housing, every structure is unique. This means that there is no baseline derived from type-testing or the expensive qualification procedures applicable for aerospace structures. Hence, a unique feature of SHM for civil infrastructure is that a major part of the system\n",
    "The basic premise of SHM feature selection is that damage will significantly alter the stiffness, mass or energy dissipation properties of a system, which, in turn, alter the measured dynamic response of that system. Although the basis for feature selection appears intuitive, its actual application poses many significant technical challenges. The most fundamental challenge is the fact that damage is typically a local phenomenon and may not significantly influence the lower-frequency global response of structures that is normally measured during system operation. Stated another way, this fundamental challenge is similar to that in many engineering fields where the ability to capture the system response on widely varying length- and time-scales, as is needed to model turbulence or to develop phenomenological models of energy dissipation, has proven difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another fundamental challenge is that in many situations feature selection and damage identification must be performed in an unsupervised learning mode. That is, data from damaged systems are not available. Damage can accumulate over widely varying time-scales, which poses significant challenges for the SHM sensing system. This challenge is supplemented by many practical issues associated with making accurate and repeatable measurements over long periods of time at a limited number of locations on complex structures often operating in adverse environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a significant challenge for SHM is to develop the capability to define the required sensing system properties before field deployment and, if possible, to demonstrate that the sensor system itself will not be damaged when deployed in the field. If the possibility of sensor damage exists, it will be necessary to monitor the sensors themselves. This monitoring can be accomplished either by developing appropriate self-validating sensors or by using the sensors to report on each other's condition. Sensor networks should also be ‘fail-safe’. If a sensor fails, the damage identification algorithms must be able to adapt to the new network. This adaptive capability implies that a certain amount of redundancy must be built into the sensor network.\n",

    "The feature selection process is denoted as in art in it self (farrar2007introduction) and is a subject of bias and error. and the process sometimes needs experimentally-validated finite elemnt models to be able to simulate damage scenarios and select the best features for that particular damage scenarion.\n",

The rational behind using softmax is that this function give us the confidence of the model in it's classification (not completly true). As we believe that once the structure is damaged the model will not be able to classify it correctly.\n",
    "- This approach is not limited only on the softmax function, other functions can be used to build the damage index. For example, the distance between the logits layer of the healthy data and the logits layer of the data to be classified can be used as a damage index by using for instance a gaussian mixture model.\n",
    "- This approach is not limited to a population of different structure, one can also train the model at the auxiliary task to distinguish between different load cases, for example, looking at train passage on a railway bridge instrumanted with FGBs, we can ask the model to distinguish between the different train passage. Another use case is if we have a symetrical structure like an electrical pylon and four sensor are installed in each face of the pylon, we can ask the model to distinguish between the different faces of the pylon. the faces are supposed to be similar, however, the model will learn the difference between the faces.\n",

The Scree plot criterion \\cite{cattell1966scree}, also known as the 'elbow rule', is utilized to determine the number of principal components to consider. The intention is not to compete with the baseline method, as one is feature-based and the other considers the entire spectrum. These two methods perform better when complementing each other. The objective here is to have a better quantification of the performance of the proposed approach w.r.t. a commonly accepted strategy for SHM.
