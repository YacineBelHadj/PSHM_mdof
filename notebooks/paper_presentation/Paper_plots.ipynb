    "### Model training and damage detection\n",
    "- The proposed methodolody is based on an auxillary task of classification.\n",
    "- In case of a population of similar structures, the model is trained to identify the structure from which the data is coming from.\n",
    "- Therefore, the model learns descriminative features that makes each structure unique.\n",
    "- It is assumed that those features are also the ones that are affected by damage.\n",
    "- Once the model is trained, the ultimate layer,often called logits layer, is used to build a damage index. A simple damage index would be the softmax function applied to this layer. The rational behind using softmax is that this function give us the confidence of the model in it's classification (not completly true). As we believe that once the structure is damaged the model will not be able to classify it correctly.\n",
    "- This approach is not limited only on the softmax function, other functions can be used to build the damage index. For example, the distance between the logits layer of the healthy data and the logits layer of the data to be classified can be used as a damage index by using for instance a gaussian mixture model.\n",
    "- This approach is not limited to a population of different structure, one can also train the model at the auxiliary task to distinguish between different load cases, for example, looking at train passage on a railway bridge instrumanted with FGBs, we can ask the model to distinguish between the different train passage. Another use case is if we have a symetrical structure like an electrical pylon and four sensor are installed in each face of the pylon, we can ask the model to distinguish between the different faces of the pylon. the faces are supposed to be similar, however, the model will learn the difference between the faces.\n",

We employ a PCA-based approach to identify a linear subspace where environmental effects are located and compute the residual of the projection onto this subspace to remove the environmental effects\\cite{deraemaeker2008vibration}. The Scree plot criterion \\cite{cattell1966scree}, also known as the 'elbow rule', is utilized to determine the number of principal components to consider. The intention is not to compete with the baseline method, as one is feature-based and the other considers the entire spectrum. These two methods perform better when complementing each other. The objective here is to have a better quantification of the performance of the proposed approach w.r.t. a commonly accepted strategy for SHM. Notice that the PCA here is the perfect solution as the latent variable is linear affectign the res freq (polynomial relation ship between res and latent var) .\n"
